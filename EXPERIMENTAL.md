# Experimental Features
> **Warning**: Experimental features are under development. They may break, change or be removed entirely.

1. System Tray
   - Introduced in version `0.4.4`, marked as experimental in version `0.4.6`
   - New widget: `tray` - using the `stray` crate
   - Not likely to become available as a stable feature anytime soon, because `stray` is overall hacky and a mess.

   "left-tray_tray": {}
