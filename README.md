# HybridBar
A Wayland status bar made in Rust
## What does it support?
It supports:
- Basic labels;
- Labels with output from a terminal command (or script);
- Transparency

A.K.A It's a simple status bar I put together with gtk-layer-shell and GTK 3 because I couldn't be bothered with more weird, half-broken bars.
## Does it support buttons?
No, if you want buttons support then you either wait for me to add it (a.k.a when I need it), or you can submit a PR and add it yourself.

**Make sure all PRs follow the current code style**.
